# CSGO .ain files
Files for bot waypoints in CSGO
Just put the files under /maps/graphs/ directory.

This repository mainly focuses on zombie escape maps (ze_ prefix) and zombie survival maps (zm_ prefix).
Hopefully this helps new server owners/admins who would like to play with bots without spending a lot of time generating .ain files.

Good luck and have fun :)
